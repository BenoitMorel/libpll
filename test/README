PLL test framework
------------------

  src/    - source of test cases
  obj/    - binaries of test cases (automatically generated)
  out/    - expected output
  result/ - output of failed tests

A. Update test framework
------------------------

  How to create a new test:

    1. Place test case source file %.c into src/
       Use a descriptive but short name
       You could also write a long description into this file

    2. Compile with the provided Makefile
       A binary with the same name (%) should be created in obj/

    3. Validate it propertly!
       Every time you place a buggy test case, god kills a kitten
             (and we do not want that)

    4. Pipe the output into out/%.out

    5. Proceed to section B and verify it matches the output and there are no leaks

B. Run the test framework
-------------------------

  1. Run `make` for compiling the test cases

  2. Run `runtest.py` for executing the tests

  3. Check the output for errors

  4. If any of the tests fail, go and fix your code!
     The wrong output will be placed in result/
